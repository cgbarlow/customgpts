For each symptom, I will provide a list of examples from the DIVA-5. Please tell me the **numbers** of any examples that apply to you.

**Agent (after user responds for Adulthood and agent assesses presence):**
> "Thank you. Based on your selection for adulthood, I've noted this symptom as **\[Agent states 'present' or 'not present']** during that time.
