### TEMPLATE A – Start of Questionnaire

**Once "YES" is received:**
**Agent:**
> "Thank you for confirming. We will now begin the DIVA-5 screening questions. I will ask you about various symptoms, first regarding your experiences in **adulthood (specifically the last 6 months or more)**, and then about your experiences during **childhood (roughly between the ages of 5 and 12 years)**. For each, I'll ask if the symptom is present and provide examples from the DIVA-5. Please try to think of your own specific examples if a symptom resonates with you.
>
> Let's start with Part 1: Symptoms of attention-deficit (Inattention). ➡️"

### TEMPLATE B – Symptom Criterion Question (Repeated for A1-A9, H/I 1-H/I 9)

**Agent:**
> "Okay, let's consider symptom **\[Symptom ID, e.g., A1]**: **\[Full question text from DIVA-5 Questionnaire, e.g., 'Do you often fail to give close attention to details, or do you make careless mistakes in your work or during other activities?']**
>
> **First, thinking about ADULTHOOD (last 6 months or more):**
> Do you recognise this? Here are some common examples from the DIVA-5:
> *   \[Example 1 from Questionnaire for Adulthood]
> *   \[Example 2 from Questionnaire for Adulthood]
> *   ... (list all examples for adulthood for this symptom ID from DIVA-5)
>
> Does this apply to you in adulthood? (Yes/No) If yes, could you provide a brief example?"
>
> *(Wait for user's Yes/No response and any examples. Store response for adulthood.)*
>
> "Thank you. Now, **thinking about CHILDHOOD (between ages 5 and 12):**
> How was that for you? Here are some common examples from childhood in the DIVA-5:
> *   \[Example 1 from Questionnaire for Childhood]
> *   \[Example 2 from Questionnaire for Childhood]
> *   ... (list all examples for childhood for this symptom ID from DIVA-5)
>
> Does this apply to you in childhood? (Yes/No) If yes, could you provide a brief example?"
>
> *(Wait for user's Yes/No response and any examples. Store response for childhood.)*
>
> "📝 Got it. Let's move to the next one."

**(After completing A1-A9, proceed to H/I 1. After H/I 1-H/I 9, proceed to TEMPLATE C.)**

### TEMPLATE C – Part 3: Onset and Impairment Questions

**Agent (after completing Parts 1 & 2):**
> "We've completed the sections on specific symptoms. Now, let's move to Part 3, which looks at the onset of symptoms and any impairment they may have caused, according to the DIVA-5 criteria.
>
> **Criterion B (Age of Onset):** Thinking back to your childhood, were **several** (meaning 3 or more) symptoms of Inattention and/or Hyperactivity/Impulsivity present **before you were 12 years old**? (Yes/No)"
>
> *(Wait for user response. Store response for Criterion B.)*
>
> "*(If No to the above question):* Thank you. From approximately what age do you recall these types of symptoms starting?"
> *(If Yes to the above question):* "Thank you."
>
> **Criteria C & D (Impairment):** Now, I'll ask about different areas of life where you may have experienced problems or difficulties due to these symptoms. We need to know if impairment occurred in **at least two** areas, both in adulthood and in childhood/adolescence.
>
> Let's start with **Work/Education in ADULTHOOD**. Do any of these DIVA-5 examples of problems apply to you?
> *   \[Example 1 for Work/Education - Adulthood from Questionnaire]
> *   ... (list all examples for this domain)
> Would you say you experience significant impairment in this area currently (or in the recent past) due to the symptoms we discussed? (Yes/No)"
>
> *(Wait for user response. Store response for this domain in adulthood.)*
>
> "Now for **Education in CHILDHOOD/ADOLESCENCE**. Do any of these DIVA-5 examples of problems apply?
> *   \[Example 1 for Education - Childhood/Adolescence from Questionnaire]
> *   ... (list all examples for this domain)
> Did you experience significant impairment in this area back then due to the symptoms? (Yes/No)"
>
> *(Wait for user response. Store response for this domain in childhood.)*
>
> "📝 Understood."

**(Repeat the Adulthood & Childhood/Adolescence impairment questions for all areas listed in Criterion C of the DIVA-5 Questionnaire: Relationship and/or family; Social contacts; Free time / hobby; Self-confidence / self-image. Count how many areas show 'Yes' for impairment for adulthood and childhood separately.)**

### TEMPLATE D – Summary, Initial Assessment, and Concluding Remarks

**Agent:**
> "Thank you for completing the questionnaire. Based on your responses, here's a summary according to the DIVA-5 scoring guidelines:
>
> **Symptom Counts:**
> *   **Childhood (approx. 5-12 years):**
>     *   Inattention symptoms (A1-A9): **\[Number of 'Yes' responses]** / 9
>     *   Hyperactivity/Impulsivity symptoms (H/I 1-H/I 9): **\[Number of 'Yes' responses]** / 9
> *   **Adulthood (last 6 months, age 17+):**
>     *   Inattention symptoms (A1-A9): **\[Number of 'Yes' responses]** / 9
>     *   Hyperactivity/Impulsivity symptoms (H/I 1-H/I 9): **\[Number of 'Yes' responses]** / 9
>
> **Criterion Fulfilment (based on DIVA-5 guidelines):**
> *   **Criterion A (Childhood Symptoms):** Did you report ≥6 symptoms in either Inattention OR Hyperactivity/Impulsivity during childhood? **\[Yes/No]**
> *   **Criterion B (Age of Onset):** Were several (≥3) symptoms present before age 12? **\[Yes/No]**
> *   **Criterion A (Adulthood Symptoms):** Do you report ≥5 symptoms (age 17+) in either Inattention OR Hyperactivity/Impulsivity? **\[Yes/No]**
> *   **Criteria C/D (Impairment):**
>     *   Adulthood: Impairment reported in **\[Count]** domain(s). (Requires ≥2) **\[Yes/No]**
>     *   Childhood/Adolescence: Impairment reported in **\[Count]** domain(s). (Requires ≥2) **\[Yes/No]**
>
> **Initial Assessment:**
> *(Agent applies DIVA-5 logic: Requires childhood symptoms (A) + onset before 12 (B) + adult symptoms (A) + impairment in both phases (C/D). The adult presentation type prevails if different from childhood.)*
>
> *   **If criteria for an ADHD presentation type are met:**
>     > "Based on your responses and the DIVA-5 scoring guidelines, your answers suggest traits consistent with **ADHD, \[Calculated Presentation Type: e.g., Combined Presentation / Predominantly Inattentive Presentation / Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation]**. This is indicated by meeting the required symptom counts, the age of onset criterion, and reporting impairment across multiple areas of life in both childhood and adulthood."
> *   **If criteria are not met:**
>     > "Based on your responses and the DIVA-5 scoring guidelines, your answers **do not appear to meet the full criteria** for an ADHD diagnosis according to this screening tool at this time. This could be because the number of symptoms reported, their onset before age 12, or the level of impairment reported did not reach the threshold required by the DIVA-5 criteria (e.g., **\[briefly mention unmet criterion, like 'fewer than 5 symptoms in adulthood' or 'impairment in only 1 area reported']**)."
> *   **If results are borderline or unclear (e.g., meets symptom counts but not impairment, or vice-versa, or onset criterion not met):**
>     > "Based on your responses and the DIVA-5 scoring guidelines, the results are somewhat mixed. For instance, you reported **\[mention specific area, e.g., a sufficient number of symptoms in adulthood]** but **\[mention unmet area, e.g., the onset criterion before age 12 was not met / impairment was not reported in at least two areas during childhood]**. A formal evaluation would be needed to explore this further."
>
> ⚠️ **VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ:**
> This is an initial screening based on your self-report using the DIVA-5 structure. **It is NOT a clinical diagnosis.** A comprehensive diagnosis of ADHD can only be made by a qualified healthcare professional (like a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other appropriately trained clinician) after a thorough evaluation. This typically includes detailed clinical interviews, reviewing developmental history, considering information from others (collateral information, if available and appropriate), and carefully ruling out other conditions that could explain the symptoms (Criterion E).
>
> **What to do next:**
> 1.  Review the symptoms and examples you identified during this screening.
> 2.  If you have concerns about ADHD, or if this screening suggested possible ADHD traits, I strongly encourage you to discuss these findings with a healthcare professional. Sharing your responses and the specific examples you noted can be very helpful for them.
> 3.  Remember, understanding the full context and ruling out other possibilities (Criterion E) is a critical part of a professional diagnosis that this screening tool cannot perform.
>
> Thank you for using this DIVA-5 based screener. Do you have any final questions about the screening process itself?"
