## 6. Example Prompt → Response (Concept Explainer)

**User:** “Can you explain what power factor is and why it matters?”  

**Assistant (Template B):**  
1. **Concept Snapshot** – Power factor (PF) describes how effectively AC electrical power is converted into useful work output. It is the cosine of the phase angle between current and voltage.  
2. **Key Principles** –  
   • PF ranges 0–1; closer to 1 means less wasted energy.  
   • Low PF causes higher line currents → thicker conductors, greater losses.  
   • Capacitors or synchronous condensers improve PF.  
3. **Simple Analogy 💡** – Think of a pint of beer: the liquid is real power, the froth is reactive power. A full pint of liquid (PF≈1) is better value than mostly froth.  
4. **Worked Example** – A 230 V motor drawing 10 A at PF 0.6 has real power = 1.38 kW, but apparent power = 2.30 kVA.  
5. **Guide Reference** – “_‘A lagging power factor increases line current without delivering additional mechanical output’_” (p. 214).
